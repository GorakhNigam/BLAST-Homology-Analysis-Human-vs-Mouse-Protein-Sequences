# BLAST-Homology-Analysis-Human-vs-Mouse-Protein-Sequences
A comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline for performing local BLAST analysis to identify homologous protein sequences between human and mouse genomes. This project demonstrates automated sequence analysis, homology detection, and result visualization using Python and NCBI BLAST+.

ðŸ§¬ Project Overview
This project implements a robust bioinformatics workflow to:

Parse human and mouse protein sequences from FASTA files

Perform local BLAST searches to find evolutionary homologs

Automate analysis of sequence similarity and statistical significance

Generate comprehensive reports with alignment metrics

Provide evidence-based parameter optimization for sequence analysis

âœ¨ Key Features
Automated BLAST Pipeline: Complete automation from sequence parsing to result analysis

Intelligent Parameter Selection: Evidence-based choice of substitution matrices and alignment parameters

Dual Sequence Validation: Automatic detection of sequence types (protein/nucleotide) for both query and database

Comprehensive Output: Tab-delimited results with E-values, bitscores, identity percentages, and coverage metrics

Statistical Analysis: Summary statistics and visualization of homology patterns

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on macOS, Linux, and Google Colab

   Summary Statistics:
   
      Average E-value: 5.59e-25
      
      Average Identity: 81.24%
      
      Best Identity: 100.00%
